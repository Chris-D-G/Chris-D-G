Hi! My name is Chris. I'm a versatile engineer with a strong background in mechanical engineering, eagerly embarking on a new career as a software engineer. I bring a unique blend of analytical problem-solving skills, meticulous attention to detail, and a knack for creative solutions to the realm of software development.

In my current journey, I'm diligently honing my Java development skills at Tech Elevator's intensive coding bootcamp. Over three months, I've immersed myself in software engineering and tackled exciting challenges like building a command-line vending machine and crafting a robust RESTful API for an online payment service.

With over 11 years of mechanical engineering experience, I possess a solid foundation in project management, quality control, and technical problem-solving. 

My transition to software engineering is guided by my passion for innovation and my eagerness to embrace new challenges. My recent capstone projects demonstrate my ability to design and implement intricate software systems, including an online payment service and vending machine software. I've showcased proficiency in Java, RESTful Web Services, Spring Framework, and Postman API, among other essential skills. I'm excited to begin my next big project!

I'm unwavering in my commitment to continuous learning and growth, constantly exploring new technologies, programming languages, and methodologies in the dynamic realm of software engineering. My journey is underpinned by a dedication to excellence and a genuine enthusiasm for solving intricate problems through code.
