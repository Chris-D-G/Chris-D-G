Hi! My name is Chris. I'm a versatile engineer with a strong background in mechanical engineering, eagerly embarking on a new career as a software engineer. I bring a unique blend of analytical problem-solving skills, meticulous attention to detail, and a knack for creative solutions to the realm of software development. 

In my current journey, I've gained Java development skills by graduating from Tech Elevator's intensive <strong>Full Stack</strong> coding boot camp. Over three months, I've immersed myself in software engineering and tackled exciting challenges like building a command-line vending machine, crafting a robust RESTful API for an online payment service, and most recently a trading card game collection management full stack web app.

I'm unwavering in my commitment to continuous learning and growth, constantly exploring new technologies, programming languages, and methodologies in the dynamic realm of software engineering. My journey is underpinned by a dedication to excellence and a genuine enthusiasm for solving intricate problems through code. I'm excited to begin my next big project!

Languages I want to learn: 
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
    * Why? - Despite the memes about it dying, considering that a large portion of the web runs on PHP, it makes sense to learn about it.
* [GO](https://go.dev/)
    * Why? - A more modern language that seems to be in demand.
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
   * Why? - To learn functional/dynamic programming skills. It also seems to be very popular per the StackOverflow Survey.

Frameworks / Technologies I want to look into: 
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    * Why? - Versatility in CSS frameworks!
* [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
    * Why? - To add to my knowledge of Vue and associated systems.
* [Astro](https://astro.build/)
    * Why? - A framework designed for speed? Sounds cool!
* [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
    * Why? - Even with my limited experience with Node, it already feels slow.
